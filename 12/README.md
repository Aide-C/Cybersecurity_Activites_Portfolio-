# Improve Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for a Small Business
In this activity, I assessed the access controls used by a business. I analyzed their current process, identify issues, and make recommendations to improve their security practices.
Previously, I learned that access controls are security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information. 
Authentication controls are used to verify who someone is, whereas authorization controls are used to grant a user permissions and set limits on the things they’re allowed to do.
When done well, access controls are the key to decreasing the likelihood of a security risk.

The scenario:
I am the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business. Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account.
The finance manager says they didn’t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner had asked me to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.
To do this, I needed to do some accounting on the incident to better understand what happened. First, I reviewed the access log of the incident. Next, I took notes that can help me identify a possible threat actor. 
Then, I spotted issues with the access controls that were exploited by the user. Finally, I recommended mitigations that can improve the business' access controls and reduce the likelihood that this incident reoccurs.
