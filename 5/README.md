# Analysis of Network Hardening
In the course, I learned network hardening and network security-related hardening practices, such as port filtering, network access privileges, and encryption over networks. 
Network hardening practices help organizations monitor potential threats and attacks on their network and prevent some attacks from occurring. 
Some hardening practices are implemented every day, while others are executed every once in a while, such as every other week or once a month. 
Understanding how to use network hardening tools and methods will help me better monitor network activity and protect a organization’s network against various attacks.

In this activity, I was presented with a scenario about a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. 
To address the breach, I identified some common network hardening tools that can be implemented to protect the organization’s overall security. 
Then, I selected a specific vulnerability that the company had and proposed different network hardening methods. 
Finally, I wrote a security risk assessment explaining how the methods and tools I chosed will be effective for managing the vulnerability and how they will prevent potential breaches in the future. 


The scenario:
I am a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. 
My organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, I discovered four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
1. The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.
