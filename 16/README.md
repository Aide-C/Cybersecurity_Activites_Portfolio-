# Research Network Protocol Analyzers
In this activity, I focused on the two network protocol analyzers: Wireshark and tcpdump. My goal is to gain a basic understanding of the Wireshark and tcpdump, how they work, and what their features are.
As I've learned, a network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Network protocol analyzers help security analysts examine and understand the network traffic flows.

The scenario:
In my role as a cybersecurity analyst, I was asked to research the differences and similarities between Wireshark and tcpdump and create a chart that outlines my findings.
