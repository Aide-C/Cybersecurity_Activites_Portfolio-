# Use Linux Commands to Manage File Permissiions
In this activity, I created a new report document to demonstrate my experience using Linux commands to manage file permissions.

The scenario:
I am a security professional at a large organization. I mainly worked with their research team. Part of my job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions.
This helps keep the system secure. My task was to examine existing permissions on the file system. I needed to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. 
If they do not match, I needed to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

Note: This scenario involves investigating and updating the same file permissions as the ones in the course's Manage authorization Quwiklab. I revisited the lab to get screenshots to include in the report document.
