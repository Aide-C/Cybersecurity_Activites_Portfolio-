# Use a Playbook to Respond to a Phishing Incident 
In this activity, I responded to a phishing incident that involves a malicious file hash. This is the same SHA256 file hash that I investigated and verified as malicious in a activity 17. I followed the playbook instructions to investigate and resolve the incident's alert ticket

Previously, I learned how playbooks outline the step-by-step actions necessary to properly respond to a security incident. Coordinated, effective, and quick action is critical during incident response. A playbook can help security teams minimize the impact of an incident and reduce the incident response time. As a security analyst, playbooks can help guide me to effectively support an organization's incident response efforts.

The scenario:
I am a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, I received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment has already been verified malicious. Now that I had this information, I followed my organization's process to complete my investigation and resolve the alert.

My organization's security policies and procedures describe how to respond to specific alerts, including what to do when I receive a phishing alert. 
In the playbook, there is a flowchart and written instructions to help me complete my investigation and resolve the alert. At the end of my investigation, I updated the alert ticket with my findings about the incident.
