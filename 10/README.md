# Score Risks Based on their Likeihood and Severity 
In this activity, I practiced performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. 
Then, I decided how to prioritize my resources based on the risk scores I assign each vulnerability.

Recall that the purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks.
Assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned to prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.

The scenario:
I've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. 
As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.
A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.
My supervisor asks me to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, I first determined how likely that risk is to occur. 
Then, I determined how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, I calculated a score for the severity of that risk. 
I compared scores across all risks so my team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
