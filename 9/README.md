# Classify the Assets Connected to a Home Network
In this activity, I classified assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. 
Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

The scenario:
One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.
An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.
I'm operating a small business from my home and must create an inventory of my network devices. This will help me determine which ones contain sensitive information that requires extra protection.

To do this, I started by identifying three devices that have access to my home network. This includes devices such as:
- Desktop or laptop computers
- Smartphones
- Smart home devices
- Game consoles
- Storage devices or servers
- Video streaming devices
  
Then, I listed important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, I assigned each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.
